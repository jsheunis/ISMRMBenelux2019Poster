# rtme-fMRI: Real-time multi-echo fMRI processing scripts

This repo contains SPM12 and Matlab-based scripts to run real-time processing on multi-echo fMRI data. It also contains the code necessary to reproduce the results presented at poster P-043 at ISMRM Benelux 2019:

Improving BOLD sensitivity with real-time multi-echo echo-planar imaging - towards a cleaner neurofeedback signal
